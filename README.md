# A Timer For Work
Based on a project for Angela Yu's Python course, 100 Days to Code, this is currently just a Pomodoro Timer, but the intention is to turn it into an all purpose and customizable timer which (when it goes off) will shoot to the top of your windows and play a noise. Nothing fancy but some fun work.

## List of Features
* Jump to the Top of Windows (current)
* Customizable Time (in progress)
* Customizable Art (in progress)
* Ability to Play Spotify (future)
* Soundeffect When Timer Ends (future)

### Licence
This is and will forever be under an unlicense. Don't go wild now.
